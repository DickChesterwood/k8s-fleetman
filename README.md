# k8s Fleetman

A new version of "Fleetman", my thrilling example microservice architecture.

This version targets Kubernetes as the orchestration system. We're going to use k8s features to achieve this, whilst simplifying the implementation. Only Hystrix and Feign from NetflixOSS are used.

This code supports the training course available at https://www.udemy.com/kubernetes-microservices/?couponCode=K8SGHUB

I'm using the issue tracker to manage the project, check the "Releases" project for progress.
